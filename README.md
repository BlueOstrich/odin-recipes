# odin-recipes
I will be creating a website for a recipe. By the end of its creation I 
will have demonstrated knowledge of the various elements we've learned
so far throughout the Odin Project, how to set up the html boilerplate,
and how to maneuver through the CLI and manage the files and directories
within it.
